 the focus shifts to using Excel PivotTables to analyze trends based on time and product.

## Question
<br>
Based on the project, the following questions were formulated: <br>

1. Create Pivot Charts to display revenue by month as a line chart, transactions by day of the week and hour of the day as column charts, and transactions by product category as a bar chart <br>
2. Assemble the charts into a rough dashboard layout, and include space for the PivotTable showing Top 15 product types. <br>
3. Add a slicer for store location, and connect it to all of the PivotTables on the sheet <br>
4. Adjust formatting, alignment and polish to finalize the dashboard <br>
